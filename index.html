            In a defining moment of our history, Bangladesh is undergoing a
            monumental transformation. After more than 15 years under a regime
            marked by corruption, oppression and exploitation, a courageous
            revolution led by our students has ignited a new era. The fall of
            this autocratic government has paved the way for an unprecedented
            opportunity to rebuild our beloved nation under the interim
            leadership of Dr. Muhammad Yunus—Nobel laureate, visionary
            economist, and a beacon of hope. This new chapter, "Bangladesh 2.0,"
            represents not just a political shift, but the rekindling of our
            national spirit.
